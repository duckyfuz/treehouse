# treehouse - allow kampong spirit to take root 
### building a community that will never leaf anybody behind

In the heart of Singapore's history lies a treasured concept - the [kampong spirit](https://www.nas.gov.sg/archivesonline/blastfromthepast/kampungspirit). Imagine a time when tight-knit communities flourished, fostering unity and genuine connections within their "kampungs," or villages. Back then, residents in a kampong shared collective responsibility for one another, creating a supportive and caring environment. Neighbours became like extended family members, building lasting bonds and friendships that instilled a strong sense of belonging and connectedness to the community.

However, in today's fast-paced and modernized world, this cherished spirit faces a daunting challenge - urbanization, technology, and individualism are [eroding the very fabric of community bonds](https://dr.ntu.edu.sg/handle/10356/78543). The close ties that once defined Singapore's cultural heritage are being put to the test.

The question arises: Can we reclaim the kampong spirit and revive the sense of togetherness that once defined Singapore's identity? While the challenges are real, the essence of the kampong spirit continues to resonate, offering hope for a future where unity and genuine connections transcend the barriers of modernity.

## ‚úåüèº The Solution.

[treehouse](https://dev.d1ykjigyeh5h3.amplifyapp.com/) offers an innovative solution to revive the kampong spirit in the face of modern challenges - users can effortlessly post and discover activities, fostering a vibrant platform for communal interaction. The emphasis on photo exchanges after events further strengthen the sense of togetherness and shared experiences among participants.

This technological approach breaks down barriers to community engagement and demonstrates that technology can be a powerful tool in reviving and nurturing the essence of the kampong spirit, preserving Singapore's rich cultural heritage for generations to come.

### üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è The Motivation

I yearned for simpler times when I could easily meet friends at the [void deck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Void_deck) for a casual game of soccer. Now, coordinating events with fellow [HDB flat](https://www.thearcadiaonline.com/what-is-hdb-housing-and-how-does-it-work/#:~:text=HDB%20housing%20is%20a%20system,prices%20for%20rent%20or%20purchase.) (Singapore's take on public housing) residents seems like a challenge amidst everybody's busy schedules, and I longed for a solution that would ensure we would never miss out on our shared passion again.

When I discovered the Hashnode AWS hackathon, I saw the perfect opportunity to bring my vision to life while embarking on the exhilarating journey of creating my very first full-stack app. Simultaneously, I wanted to gain more experience with [Amazon Web Service](https://aws.amazon.com) - the most popular cloud service worldwide, renowned for its reliability, scalability and global presence.

## üó∫Ô∏è The Journey.

The original idea for the app was ambitious - imagine an AI that recommends activities in your community according to your unique interests... but that's a bit too much for a 19-year-old prospective software developer dipping his toes into the world of full-stack development. I cut down the scope of work until I arrived at an MUP that I could build in a month.

### üìÄ Data Models

After many iterations, I settled on these 4 models.

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1690286602608/f4ba9e45-7425-4f36-a57b-334170714d1b.png align="center")

**NatActivity** serves as a platform for administrators to add nationwide activities, encompassing significant events like national holidays and community engagements. The information required for each activity is succinct, comprising its name, date, and location.

**Residence**, functioning as an enum within UserDetails, is essentially a list of residential areas. This categorization ensures that users are only presented with events relevant to their vicinity. This is a field that only administrators will have access to and will slowly grow to include every neighbourhood in Singapore.

**UserDetails**, as its name implies, serves as a repository for individual user information. This includes user-specific data such as nicknames, profile pictures, and a record of the activities they have participated in, providing a comprehensive overview of each user's engagement on the platform. (In the future, I'm planning to store this data in Authentication `attributes` instead!)

Finally, **ActivityItem** takes care of the attributes of each event - names, dates, participants, and most importantly, location. It also includes an array to store images! (or rather, the paths to the image files in the S3 bucket)

### üßëüèº‚Äçü¶≤ Amplify Authentication

Ensuring security is of paramount importance, particularly when handling sensitive information like user locations. Thanks to AWS Amplify Authentication and AWS Cognito, incorporating authentication into a new React app has become remarkably straightforward. In fact, it boiled down to just a few additions to my `index.js` file:

```javascript
import React, { StrictMode } from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom/client";

import { AmplifyProvider, Authenticator } from "@aws-amplify/ui-react";

import App from "./App";
import reportWebVitals from "./reportWebVitals";

import "./index.css";
import "@aws-amplify/ui-react/styles.css";

import config from "./aws-exports";
Amplify.configure(config);

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root"));
root.render(
  <AmplifyProvider>
    <StrictMode>
      <Authenticator.Provider>
        <App />
      </Authenticator.Provider>
    </StrictMode>
  </AmplifyProvider>
);
```

That's it! What used to take hours to create could now be done in minutes with the help of AWS Amplify. I even managed to [integrate OAuth](https://docs.amplify.aws/lib/auth/social/q/platform/js/) for users to create an account using Google without any prior expertise in authorisation frameworks!

I opted to make a personalised login page with the `<Authenticator />` component - this way, I would have space to spruce up the login page in the future. ‚ú®Fancy.‚ú®

```javascript
const services = {
    async handleConfirmSignUp({ username, code }) {
      await Auth.confirmSignUp(username, code);
      from.current = "/onboarding";
    },
  };

<Authenticator services={services} />
```

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1690370805736/722ee09a-b0e9-40b9-8476-ac2d8b00286c.png align="center")

### ü§ñ Amplify UI Library

Next, I had to decide on the UI of treehouse. I wanted to create differentiated cards for each type of activity - national, future and archived.

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1690371277121/387250ca-b257-4d34-a00a-8f0066e5759b.png align="center")

[AWS Amplify's UI Builder](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/6376798776343-AWS-Amplify-Studio-and-Figma) gives you the ability to create front-end components from Figma, and that was exactly what I did. Using Amplify Studio, I was able to create a [collection](https://docs.amplify.aws/console/tutorial/collections/) that was sorted and paginated, all without writing a single line of code!

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1690373704278/7ba2c2e6-f8a5-4d2a-b237-514db109074d.png align="center")

However, I was never able to figure out how to set dynamic component properties on Amplify Studio. Determined to find a solution, I delved into the [documentation](https://docs.amplify.aws/console/) and learned how to utilize the "[extend-via-code](https://docs.amplify.aws/console/uibuilder/override/#extend-generated-collections-via-overrideitems-prop)" approach to dynamically disable signup buttons for certain activities

```javascript
<FutureActivityModal
  overrides={{
    AttendButton: {
      isDisabled:
        attendContact[0] || attendContact[1] ? true : false,
    },
    ContactButton: {
      isDisabled: attendContact[1] ? true : false,
    },
  }}
/>
```

Undoubtedly, the most valuable feature of the UI Builder for me was its automatically generated forms. As my app heavily relied on Amplify DataStore, I was thrilled to discover that I could effortlessly map my form to an existing data model, all without the need for complex state management or validation logic. The seamless integration allowed me to submit input data directly to Amazon DynamoDB without writing a single line of code!

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1690374750729/16fc4ca5-0d13-4365-bfa4-036cddc91d92.png align="center")

While I certainly encountered some challenges while dealing with complicated components, I must admit that the UI Builder proved to be a godsend when it came to creating static components. Remarkably, I was able to create most of the homepage with only components generated from Figma!

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1690374373223/d0931206-769c-48c4-a978-1a181ba167ee.png align="center")

```javascript
<Flex>
  <HomePageIntro
    image={image}
    getStartedHandler={() => {
      navigate("/login");
    }}
  />
  <HomePageFeatures />
  <HomePageFinisher />
  <HomePageFooter />
</Flex>
```

### üóÑÔ∏è Amplify DataStore

Initially, I had planned to utilize the AWS AppSync GraphQL API for my app's data management. However, upon realizing the [numerous benefits](https://aws.amazon.com/amplify/datastore/) offered by Amplify DataStore, especially its seamless integration with form mapping to data models, I swiftly made the switch. The transition turned out to be remarkably smooth as the changes required were minimal - DataStore utilises the GraphQL query language as well!

One of the most valuable features I found was the ability to [observe query results in real time](https://docs.amplify.aws/lib/datastore/real-time/q/platform/js/#observe-model-mutations-in-real-time). To leverage this functionality across all my routes, I created a custom `useUser` Hook, enabling easy access to real-time updates for user properties.

```javascript
export const useUserObserver = () => {
  const [userDets, setUserDets] = useState(null);
  const { user, authStatus } = useAuthenticator((context) => [context.user]);

  const observeUser = () => {
    return DataStore.observeQuery(UserDetails, (c) =>
      c.name.eq(user.username)
    ).subscribe((snapshot) => {
      if (snapshot.items && snapshot.items.length) {
        setUserDets(snapshot.items[0]);
      }
    });
  };

  useEffect(() => {
    if (authStatus === "authenticated") {
      const userSubscription = observeUser();
      return () => {
        userSubscription.unsubscribe();
      };
    }
  }, [authStatus]);

  return userDets;
};
```

However, fetching data from the cloud resulted in a minor headache - I was unable to dynamically filter items before fetching them and finally had to resort to fetching every single item before filtering them by the current date and the user's selected residences.

```javascript
const sortedActivities = await DataStore.query(
  ActivityItem,
  Predicates.ALL,
  {
    sort: (s) => s.dateTime(SortDirection.DESCENDING),
  }
);
const pastActivities = filterDateTimeAfterToday(sortedActivities);
const filteredActivities = pastActivities.filter(
  (activity) =>
    userDets.residence.includes(activity.residence) &&
    (activity.participants.includes(userDets.name) ||
      activity.host === userDets.name)
);
setPastActivities(filteredActivities);
```

As you can see, it's not the cleanest code and will DEFINITELY not scale well... ü•¥  
But hey, at least it works! (for now...)

### ü™£ Amplify Storage (with S3)

Integrating an S3 bucket into my project was a breeze with the help of Amplify Studio. The user-friendly interface and clear instructions made the process remarkably easy, even for someone without extensive experience in cloud storage. Since my app's requirements were straightforward, figuring out the necessary authorization rules was a quick task.

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1690377857536/11dd515e-758a-4471-8e62-387351034a6d.png align="center")

Fetching data from the S3 bucket proved to be just as straightforward - especially after figuring out how to utilise the `public/`, `protected/` and `private/` folders of the bucket. For this project, I mainly used the `public/` folder - after all, the pictures are meant to be shared among everyone!

### üí¨ Amplify In-App Messaging

I wanted to send encouraging messages to the user when they attended or hosted activities and I found Amplify's In-App Messaging component to be EXTREMELY useful for that.

To start, I created a simple campaign in AWS Pinpoint with the trigger event `Participation` and the attribute `participated: 1`.

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1690424446278/b8df6617-8e49-4eb4-a144-86a03816c38e.png align="center")

Then, I created a segment that would target every registered user.

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1690424533418/3d61926e-5b58-403c-9aca-b5e5c80913f9.png align="center")

Finally, I created the notification itself. Once again, I did not touch a single line of code and most of the work was already done!

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1690424664518/625f7a7c-3deb-4ca9-b3d0-618c1e2e1406.png align="center")

Following the documentation, I used the `useEffect` Hook in my entry file `App.js` to sync the campaign messages and then used a custom function `attendActivityHandler` to dispatch an In-App Messaging event whenever the user indicated their attendance for an event.

```javascript
useEffect(() => {
    InAppMessaging.syncMessages();
  }, []);
```

```javascript
const attendActivityHandler = async () => {
  InAppMessaging.dispatchEvent({
    name: "Participation",
    attributes: {
      participated: user.activitiesAttended.length.toString(),
      hosted: user.activitiesHosted.length.toString(),
    },
  });
};
```

You might now be wondering why I didn't just use a popular library like [react-toastify](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-toastify) to display messages to the user...

Well, while these libraries are arguably easier to customise and simpler to use (I still have yet to figure out how to [use custom components and styles with In-App Messaging](https://ui.docs.amplify.aws/react/connected-components/in-app-messaging)), with Amplify's In-App Messaging, I can update, add and delete campaign messages on the AWS Console without making a single commit on my codebase. See for example:

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1690427034403/e0c041a3-75e6-4b9b-b3de-2d6bfc43753c.png align="center")

I've just created a few more campaign messages (with the same trigger event but different attributes) on the AWS console... within just 5 minutes!

### üìü AWS Analytics

My usage of AWS Analytics is pretty basic. All I wanted to do was to gather data for the rate of user acquisition, retention and usage rates. Imagine my surprise when I found that all these were done pretty much automatically.

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1690427427042/f6e1f121-7d1a-4f63-98bb-ce8844b2cb01.png align="center")

[Recording custom events](https://docs.amplify.aws/lib/analytics/record/q/platform/js/#recording-custom-events) through AWS Analytics proved to be an efficient way to gather additional user data, requiring only one simple line of code, namely `Analytics.record({ name: 'eventName' })`, in the app's click handlers. This approach enabled me to track various user interactions, such as how frequently users registered attendance for events, how often they hosted new events, and how frequently they accessed their archived events.

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1690428403029/a8a20ffd-48e1-4a75-9ff7-bab07f86cde0.png align="center")

With how simple the entire process was, I certainly plan to implement analytics to a greater degree in my future apps.

### üñ•Ô∏è AWS Hosting

Hosting with AWS Amplify was certainly a breeze - hands down the easiest part of the project. With just three simple lines of CLI code, my first-ever full-stack app was brought into the world.

```bash
amplify add hosting
amplify configure hosting
amplify publish
```

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1690443522290/de558170-9cda-4cea-92be-adce05fa230c.png align="center")

### üî® Usage Instructions

Upon opening the app, you'll be greeted with a summary of what the app is all about. It revolves around four key themes: (1) Embracing Unity, (2) Celebrating Diversity, (3) Reviving Spirit, and (4) Creating Lasting Memories - the core of our vision for fostering a sense of togetherness and community connection.

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1690284459412/6f0dae94-eb8d-4897-8b29-dc779ca688af.png align="center")

Clicking on the `Log In` / `Go to Dashboard` button will bring you to the `/login` screen, where you can conveniently create a new account in less than a minute.

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1690444081316/329e108a-73fd-4d3f-8e09-9a83574d8089.png align="center")

After creating an account, the user would be redirected to `/onboarding`, where they would be able to supplement their account with additional details. Here, TESTER picked a cute little robot to be his avatar! (Do remember to "Add" after selecting a residence!)

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1690444494454/e687c19f-c2e5-43a8-8759-f333d2e1f3e9.png align="center")

The Dashboard consists of "National Events" (added by administrators) and "Future Events" (added by residents). Look at how many activities other residents have already added!

TESTER seems to be craving a game of [Mahjong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahjong)... Maybe he'll join the Mahjong Marathon hosted by 25USER!

### üèãÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Struggles...

When I first started the project, I was a total JavaScript novice. I had next to no knowledge of how async functions worked and could not even create a simple loop. Frankly, even promises were a foreign concept to me.

As a result, while creating a `useEffect` function to fetch images from my S3 bucket, I mistakenly used a `forEach` loop, which does not wait for each iteration's async operation to complete before moving on. It led to unexpected behaviour, and I ended up spending hours trying to fix this one issue.

It was a stroke of luck that Hashnode's email promoting their newly released [Rix](https://hashnode.com/rix) came when it did. I hopped on the platform and pasted my code into the AI together with the error message. To my surprise, it quickly diagnosed the issue and gave out possible solutions.

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1690543245321/0768ac79-de26-451f-ba20-49dcf6ad5408.png align="center")

```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  activity &&
    (async function () {
      const participantPromises = activity.participants.map(async function (participant) {
        const user = await DataStore.query(UserDetails, participant);
        const profilePicURL = await Storage.get(user.profilePicture);
        return [user.id, [user.preferedName, profilePicURL]];
      });
      await Promise.all(participantPromises)
        .then((results) => {
          const updatedDetails = Object.fromEntries(results);
          setUserCardDetails((prevDetails) => ({
            ...prevDetails,
            ...updatedDetails,
          }));
        })
        .catch((error) => {
          console.error("Error while querying user details:", error);
        });
    })();
}, [activity]);
```

Absolutely incredible! Rix proved to be a lifesaver, and I can't help but wonder how many precious hours I could have saved if I had discovered it earlier.

From then on, whenever I faced an error I did not understand, all I had to do was paste the error into Rix to receive a detailed explanation of why the error occurred and possible solutions. Rix certainly turned out to be a great tool to learn new languages and frameworks. All hail our AI overlords. ü§ñ

### ü¶• More Struggles...

I faced some limitations while learning to use AWS Amplify's UI Library as well. To my dismay, I was unable to set dynamic filters with Amplify Studio - I could not filter the items in the collections by the current date, much less by the user's residences.

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1690545956173/709dad63-5b92-4663-9f72-b691017777a3.png align="center")

As a result, I had to resort to fetching data directly with the DataStore API before sorting and filtering the data by date and residence. This time, I used ChatGPT to create the function for filtering by date.

```javascript
export function filterDateTimeBeforeToday(activities) {
  const currentDate = new Date();
  const filteredActivities = activities.filter((activity) => {
    const testDate = new Date(activity.dateTime);
    return testDate >= currentDate;
  });
  return filteredActivities;
}
```

In the end, I decided to use the [`<Collection/>`](https://ui.docs.amplify.aws/react/components/collection) component to display the event cards instead as it allowed for more control over the items displayed.

### üòÖ Even More Struggles...

At this point, if you've already tried out the app (kudos to you!), you might notice that you're able to create events for residences that you are not part of. As a result, you can create events that won't even show up on your dashboard!

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1690547249142/c18aa697-924d-4f0d-903c-6222d195c870.png align="center")

This is because I used an automatically generated form component from the UI library - as of now, these forms [do not support dynamic dropdown fields](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/73151394/is-it-possible-to-create-a-dropdown-select-field-using-amplify-studio-ui-fig). The solution would be to create a custom form with React, but it seems that the deadline is fast approaching and there are so so many bugs I've yet to fix.

## üèÅ Conclusion

And that concludes my month-long development journey with AWS Amplify! I started this journey knowing next to nothing about AWS Amplify, and I am certainly proud of the app I have created. AWS Amplify has proven to be a powerful resource for front-end developers, enabling them to quickly build and host full-stack applications with ease.

However, as I delved deeper into the platform, I realized that AWS Amplify's simplicity also comes with some limitations. While it's a fantastic option for straightforward applications, users might find that more complex projects require a deeper understanding of AWS services, which can extend the development time.

In my opinion, AWS Amplify strikes a good balance as it's suitable for both beginners and professionals. Beginners would likely not require workarounds to bypass Amplify's limitations for straightforward applications, while professionals would probably already have the know-how to delve deeper into AWS or develop custom solutions to fit their specialised and intricate use cases.

Overall, my journey with AWS Amplify has been fruitful, and I am excited to add this versatile tool to my toolbox. The experience has opened up new possibilities for my future projects, and I look forward to further refining my skills with this valuable resource.
